    "options": ["TCP is faster but less reliable", "UDP establishes a connection before sending data", "TCP is connection-oriented, UDP is connectionless", "UDP is used for web pages, TCP for streaming"],
    "answer": "TCP is connection-oriented, UDP is connectionless",
    "isTrap": false,
    "explanation": "TCP establishes a reliable connection and guarantees packet order, whereas UDP is a faster, connectionless protocol that does not guarantee delivery."

    "question": "In the context of REST APIs, which HTTP method is idempotent?",
    "options": ["POST", "PATCH", "PUT", "GET and POST"],
    "answer": "PUT",
    "isTrap": true,
    "explanation": "Idempotent methods can be called multiple times with the same result. PUT is idempotent because it replaces the entire resource, while POST creates a new resource each time."

    "question": "In machine learning, what is 'overfitting'?",
    "options": ["When a model is too simple to capture the data's complexity", "When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data", "When a model uses too much computational power", "When a model is trained on too little data"],
    "answer": "When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data",
    "isTrap": false,
    "explanation": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data, including noise and random fluctuations, too well, hindering its ability to generalize to new data."

    "options": ["A vulnerability that takes zero days to fix", "A software vulnerability that is discovered by attackers before the vendor is aware", "A vulnerability that has zero impact on a system", "A type of open-source software license"],
    "answer": "A software vulnerability that is discovered by attackers before the vendor is aware",
    "isTrap": true,
    "explanation": "It's called 'zero-day' because the vendor has had zero days to create a patch to fix the problem."
